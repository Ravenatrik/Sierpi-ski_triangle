The Sierpiński triangle is a well-known fractal consisting of an equilateral triangle, subdivided into smaller equilateral triangles. This is an effort to create the Sierpiński triangle using a surprisingly simple algorithm 
(that I came across in an Instagram reel XD).

<br/>

The algorithm says:
- take any random point inside the equilateral triangle
- choose any one of the three vertices randomly
- take the next point as the mid-point of the line joining that vertex and the original point
- repeat this, generating new points and plotting them at each step
- after sufficient number of iterations, you should see the fractal emerging!
